# Overview
CardDesigner is a command-line program for employers looking to print out business cards for their employees. 
You can store and manipulate basic employee information like name, title, phone number, and email--this is all done with 
Firebase. Once the information is in the database, you move on to the business card menu, where you design and download
the cards by simply entering an employee ID number. The image manipulation is done with Pillow.


# Environment
